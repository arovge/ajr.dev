# ajr.dev

This is my personal website. It's built using Gatsby and served with Cloudflare Pages.

### Development

The project needs to be cloned the repository and have node module downloaded:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/austinrovge/ajr.dev.git
$ cd ajr.dev
$ yarn
```

A local development server can be started on port `8000` by running:

```bash
$ yarn start
```

A production build can be generated by running:

```bash
$ yarn build
```

This will build create the `public` directory and put the production static assets in it.


### Deployment

Currently the project is deployed with Cloudflare Pages. A development site is created for each pull request and the production site is updated when that pull request is merged into `main`.
