# ajr.dev

This is my personal website. It used to use a lot of frameworks, but I realized I didn't need the complexity or high maintainability cost that comes with modern web dev for this.

### Development

This project is very barebones. After cloning, open the html file in your web browser to view the website. After making a change to HTML/CSS, refresh your web browser to see the changes.

### Deployment

Currently the project is deployed with Cloudflare Pages. A development site is created for each pull request and the production site is updated when that pull request is merged into `main`.
